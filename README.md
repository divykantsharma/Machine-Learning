# Machine-Learning
 In this repository, I will showcase several machine learning algorithms that I've learned and worked with, including linear regression and gradient descent.


What is Machine Learning ?
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and models which enable computers to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It emphasizes the use of data to improve the performance of a system over time, allowing machines to learn from experiences and adapt to changing circumstances. Key techniques in machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Applications range from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and predictive analytics.
